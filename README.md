# Audio::OggVorbis

Perl 6 Bindings for libogg, libvorbis, and libvorbisenc.

This module depends on native libraries. You can insure that these are
properly installed on Debian environments by using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libogg-dev libvorbis-dev
```

Right now, this library only consists of library bindings, however subsequent 
releases will include a Perlish API.

Special thanks go to #perl6 on freenode. Their contributions got me this far.
